The SimController.java file defines a Java class responsible for controlling the simulation's execution, specifically managing the simulation iterations and the actions of agents within each iteration. Here's a breakdown of its functionality and role:

Summary
SimController orchestrates the simulation's flow, including iterating through simulation days (iterations) and managing agent actions and perceptions over time. It acts as the central execution mechanism that drives the simulation forward.

In-depth Description
Variables and Constructor: The class holds an array of Agent objects (agentArray) and an integer iterations indicating the number of iterations (or simulation days) to run. The constructor initializes these variables with the provided agents and the desired number of iterations.

Simulation Loop: The loop method encapsulates the core logic for running the simulation. It iterates through each day, further breaking down the simulation into hours. This granular approach allows for detailed simulation of agent activities and perceptions throughout a day.

Agent Actions and Perceptions: Within each hour of each day, the simulation updates agents' states by invoking the perceive_time method on each agent. This method likely adjusts agents' parameters based on the time of day, simulating daily cycles of activity and rest, though the specific implementation details of perceive_time are not provided in the snippet.

Time Management: The simulation explicitly manages time, iterating from hour 7 to 23 each day, suggesting a focus on daytime activities. This time management is crucial for simulating real-world scenarios where agent behaviors and interactions vary throughout the day.

Output: The method prints out logs to the console, marking the start of the simulation, each iteration (day), and each hour within an iteration. This output is useful for monitoring the simulation's progress and understanding how agent activities unfold over time.

Dependencies and Interaction with Other Components
Agent Interaction: SimController directly interacts with Agent objects, specifically calling methods that update their state based on time. This interaction is a key part of simulating dynamic behaviors and decisions based on changing environmental conditions and agents' internal states.

System Architecture: This class is central to the simulation's runtime behavior, acting on the initial conditions set up by SimInitializer. It requires the simulation environment to be set up with agents and their initial states before it can control the simulation's progression.
