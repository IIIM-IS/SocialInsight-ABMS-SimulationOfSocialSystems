# Perception.java Summary

## Overview
`Perception.java` defines a class named `Perception` that encapsulates the concept of perceptions within the simulation. These perceptions are fundamental to modeling how agents understand and interpret their environment or the state of other agents.

## Variables
- `name`: A `String` that uniquely identifies the perception.

## Constructor
- The constructor takes a `String name` as an argument, setting the name for the perception instance.

## Methods
- `toString()`: Overrides the default `toString` method to provide a string representation of the perception, which includes its name.
- `getName()`: Returns the name of the perception.
- `equals(Object o)`: Overrides the `equals` method to provide a way to compare two `Perception` objects based on their names.

## Functionality
The `Perception` class is designed to represent different types of perceptions that agents can have. These perceptions could be about the environment, other agents, or any relevant aspect of the simulation. The equality method (`equals`) suggests that each perception is considered unique based on its name, allowing for precise identification and comparison within the simulation logic.

This class provides a foundational element for building more complex behaviors and interactions in the simulation, where agents' decisions and actions can be influenced by their perceptions.
