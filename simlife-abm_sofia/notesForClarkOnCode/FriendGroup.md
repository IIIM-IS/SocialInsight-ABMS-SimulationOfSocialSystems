# FriendGroup.java Summary

## Overview
`FriendGroup.java` defines a class named `FriendGroup` that represents a collection of agents within the simulation who are considered friends. This class facilitates the modeling of social networks and group dynamics among agents, allowing for interactions and behaviors influenced by these social structures.

## Variables
- `group`: A `List<Agent>` holding the members of the friend group.

## Constructor
- The constructor accepts a `List<Agent>` as an argument, initializing the `group` with the provided list of agents.

## Methods
- `toString()`: Overrides the default `toString` method to provide a string representation of the friend group, listing its members.
- `getFriends(Agent a)`: Returns a list of `Agent` objects representing the friends of a given agent within the group. This method suggests functionality for querying the social connections of an agent.

## Functionality
The `FriendGroup` class is crucial for simulating social interactions within the simulation, offering a way to represent and manage the social context of agents. By grouping agents into friend groups, the simulation can apply different interaction rules or behaviors based on these social structures, such as spreading information, influencing decision-making, or coordinating actions among friends.

This class supports the creation of complex social networks, enabling the exploration of how group affiliations and friendships impact individual and collective behaviors within the simulation environment.
