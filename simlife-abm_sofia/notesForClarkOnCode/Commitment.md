# Commitment.java Summary

## Overview
`Commitment.java` defines a class named `Commitment` that encapsulates the concept of commitments or obligations that agents can have within the simulation. These commitments are associated with specific actions and time periods, representing scheduled or planned activities that agents are committed to.

## Variables
- `timePeriod`: An instance of `TimePeriod` that specifies the duration of the commitment.
- `action`: An `Action` object that represents the activity or task the commitment is associated with.

## Constructor
- The constructor takes an `Action` object and a `TimePeriod` instance as arguments, initializing the commitment with the specified action and time period.

## Methods
- `toString()`: Provides a string representation of the commitment, including the name of the associated action and the commitment's time period.
- `getTimeStart()`: Returns the start time of the commitment's time period.
- `getTimeEnd()`: Returns the end time of the commitment's time period.

## Functionality
The `Commitment` class plays a key role in the simulation by representing temporal obligations or scheduled actions for agents. This allows the simulation to account for agents' future activities, influencing their availability and decision-making processes based on their commitments. By associating commitments with specific actions and time frames, the simulation can more accurately model the complexities of agent behaviors and interactions over time.

This class enables the simulation to incorporate aspects of planning and scheduling into agent behaviors, adding depth to the simulation's representation of agent activities and priorities.
