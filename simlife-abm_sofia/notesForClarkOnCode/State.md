Summary
State encapsulates a single state attribute, identified by a name, allowing for the representation of various states that agents or objects in the simulation can possess. This basic structure is key to tracking and managing different conditions that influence decision-making and actions.

In-depth Description
State Name: The core attribute of the class is stateName, which uniquely identifies the state. This name is used to reference the state within the simulation, enabling the system to check for specific conditions or apply changes based on state transitions.

Constructor: The class constructor takes a stateName argument, setting up the initial state name for the instance.

Equality Method: It overrides the equals method to allow for state comparison based on the stateName attribute. This functionality is essential for logic that involves checking whether an entity is in a particular state, facilitating condition checks and triggers within the simulation logic.
