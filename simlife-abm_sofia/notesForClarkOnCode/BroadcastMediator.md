# BroadcastMediator.java Summary

## Overview
`BroadcastMediator.java` outlines an interface named `BroadcastMediator`, which defines a contract for classes that handle the broadcasting of perceptions to agents within the simulation. This interface is fundamental for implementing communication mechanisms between agents, focusing on the dissemination of perceptions.

## Methods
- `sendPerception(Perception p, Agent a)`: Specifies a method to send a `Perception` to an `Agent`. Implementing classes are expected to define the logic for how perceptions are broadcast, potentially to a single agent, a group of agents, or agents within a certain proximity or relational context.

## Functionality
The `BroadcastMediator` interface provides a standardized approach to implementing different broadcasting strategies within the simulation. By defining a common method for perception dissemination, the simulation framework allows for flexible communication patterns, supporting a variety of interaction models between agents.

Implementations of this interface can vary in their approach to broadcasting, from sending messages to all agents within the environment to more nuanced strategies like broadcasting only to friends or agents within a specific area. This flexibility is crucial for modeling complex social and environmental interactions, enabling the simulation to capture a wide range of communication dynamics and behavioral influences.
