Summary
Preconditions encapsulates the conditions that must be satisfied for an action to be executed by an agent. It supports complex decision-making processes by ensuring actions are taken in appropriate contexts, enhancing the simulation's realism and depth.

In-depth Description
Attributes:

name: Identifies the precondition set.
location: Specifies a location requirement for the action.
resource: Specifies a resource requirement for the action.
time: Specifies a time period during which the action can be executed.
locationAction and resourceAction: Links to specific MoveTo and Acquire actions, respectively, that are necessary to fulfill the location and resource requirements.
Functionality:

The class provides methods to set various preconditions (setLocation, setResource, setTime) and to link these preconditions with corresponding actions (setMoveTo, setAcquire).
The isPossible method evaluates whether the preconditions are met at a given time, considering the current time, location, and available resources. This functionality is crucial for dynamic environments where conditions change over time.
It also includes utility methods such as matchesLocation and hasLocation to assist in precondition checks, particularly useful for actions requiring agents to be in specific locations.
Precondition Evaluation:

preconditionsValue calculates a score based on how many preconditions are satisfied relative to the total number of preconditions. This scoring can inform decision-making processes, helping agents to choose actions that are most feasible or rewarding under current conditions.
