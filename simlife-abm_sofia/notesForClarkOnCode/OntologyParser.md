The OntologyParser.java file is a Java class designed to parse and interpret ontology data, serving as a bridge between the simulation's underlying ontology model and the runtime environment. This class plays a crucial role in initializing the simulation with data-driven parameters, actions, and relationships. Here's a summary followed by a detailed description:

Summary
OntologyParser extracts and processes ontology-based configurations for the simulation, including parameters, actions (e.g., MoveTo, Acquire, Consume), and perception relationships. It dynamically constructs simulation elements based on the ontology, enabling flexible and extensible simulation setups.

In-depth Description
Ontology Interaction: The class interacts with an ontology model to retrieve information about simulation parameters, actions, and their relationships. This interaction involves executing SPARQL queries against the ontology to extract necessary data.

Parameter and Action Initialization: It initializes simulation parameters and actions by retrieving their definitions from the ontology. This includes parameter factors, weights, and specific actions like movement, acquisition, and consumption, along with their preconditions and effects.

Perception Relationship Handling: The parser also deals with perception relationships, which define how agents perceive their environment and other entities within the simulation. These relationships are crucial for enabling agents to make informed decisions based on their perceptions.

Utility Methods: The class contains utility methods for specific tasks, such as retrieving parameter factors, weights, and action components. These methods support the dynamic creation of simulation elements based on the ontology, ensuring that the simulation reflects the configured ontology model accurately.

Dependencies: This class heavily depends on the ontology model for its operation. It uses SPARQL queries to interact with the model and requires a deep integration with the simulation's data structure, particularly with classes representing parameters, actions, and perceptions.

Flexibility and Extensibility: By relying on an ontology for simulation configuration, OntologyParser provides a flexible and extensible mechanism for defining simulation parameters and behaviors. This approach allows for easy updates and modifications to the simulation setup without requiring changes to the simulation codebase.
