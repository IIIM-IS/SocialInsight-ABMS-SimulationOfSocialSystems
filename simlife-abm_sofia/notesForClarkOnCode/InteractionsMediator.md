# InteractionsMediator.java Summary

## Overview
`InteractionsMediator.java` defines an interface named `InteractionsMediator`, which specifies a set of methods for mediating interactions within the simulation. This interface is pivotal for calculating the effects of various actions and perceptions on the parameters of agents or objects, facilitating complex interactions and behaviors.

## Methods
- `isVariable(String str)`: Determines if a given string represents a variable within the context of an interaction.
- `isOperator(String str)`: Identifies if a given string is an operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) used in calculating interaction effects.
- `calculateParameterEffect(ParameterState subject, ParameterState object, String function)`: Calculates the effect of an interaction on a parameter, given the subject and object of the interaction and a function describing the effect.
- `calculatePerceptionEffect(ParameterState object, String function)`: Computes the effect of a perception on a parameter, based on a specified function.
- `internalInteraction(ParameterState ps)`: Handles internal interactions affecting a single parameter state.
- `perceptionInteraction(PerceptionStateRelationship relationship)`: Manages the effects of perceptions on parameter states through specified relationships.

## Functionality
The `InteractionsMediator` interface abstracts the logic required to mediate and compute the outcomes of interactions within the simulation. It supports a variety of interaction types, from direct parameter modifications to more complex changes driven by perceptions and internal states. Implementing classes are expected to provide concrete logic for these operations, enabling the simulation to dynamically reflect the consequences of agent actions and environmental changes.

By defining a standard set of methods for interaction mediation, the simulation framework can ensure consistent and modular handling of the diverse interactions that occur within its environment, supporting a rich and adaptable simulation model.
