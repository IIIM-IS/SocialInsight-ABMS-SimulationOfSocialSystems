# Message.java Summary

## Overview
`Message.java` outlines the structure of a `Message` class, which appears to be designed for encapsulating messages within the simulation. These messages could be used for communication between agents or between agents and the simulation environment.

## Variables
- `type`: A `String` that likely categorizes the message into different types or purposes.
- `message`: A `String` containing the actual message content.

## Functionality
The provided snippet of `Message.java` shows the class with two primary variables, `type` and `message`, but does not include method definitions, constructors, or additional functionality within the provided excerpt. The intention behind the `Message` class seems to be to provide a standardized way to represent and transmit information within the simulation, potentially supporting a variety of communication types and content.

Given the brevity of the provided content, the full capabilities, and the intended use of the `Message` class within the simulation context remain to be fully described. It is expected that methods for creating messages, setting their content, and possibly methods for processing or responding to messages would be part of a complete implementation.
